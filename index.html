    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><em>I've been an entreprenuer for almost 20 years. I attended a series of community colleges,
            before transfering to, and then dropping out of Columbia University in the City of New York, 
            where I was a Junior studying Ecomomics and Writing. Currently, I run two small businesses, that cover my life. A few 
            years ago, I got into a pair of bad car accidents that caused me to rethink the direction of my career.
            After a lot of thought, I'm retraining, and studying to become a software engineer. I was raised in tech family, 
            and have always loved technology, so this feels right. I'm open to see where this decision goes.</em></p>
